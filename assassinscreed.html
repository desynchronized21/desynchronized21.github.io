			<h3>Assassin's Creed 1</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style="text-align: left;">The game starts with introducing us to the two protagonists of the story Desmond Miles and Altaïr Ibn-LaʼAhad.
					Altaïr makes some mistakes at the beginning and is deranked among the Assassin order. He must make his way back up by fighting enemies of the order and safeguard freedom of people.
					The graphics are old but the game makes up for it.
					The best part is when you wait silently in the shadows stalking your target and kill him with the hidden blade.
					
					The combat is fun and empowering but sometimes tedious. As you move further you can upgrade the abilities and equipment making the combats more fun and enjoyable. 
			
					The game is sometimes tireing because of the long journeys but the game is totally worth playing.
					Assassin's Creed really brought us into a new era of games.
					So i suggest to all my readers if u have not played it yet just start and enjoy then game yourself.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed 2</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Assassin's Creed begins with the birth of our new ancestral protagonist Ezio Auditore da Firenze.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Brotherhood</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">The game begins after the immediate end of Assassin's Creed 2. 
					Ezio visits his family village where the pope's son Cesare Borgia attacks and kills Ezio's uncle Mario. 
					Filled with the greed of gaining the apple of Eden introduced to us in Assassin's creed 2, Ezio must race against time to find the apple before Cesare. 
					This game has brought many side quests of finding interesting treasures like Romulus armor. 
					We can repair the shops in the city destroy Borgia towers to loosen up Borgia's grip on the city of Rome. 
					The game makes it quite pleasurable to freely roam in the city of Rome and fixing the broken walls and all makes it a lot of fun.
					The side quests of destroying war machines like the flying bomber, the tank , warship designed by the one and only Leonardo Da Vinci adds a thrill to the game. 
					The end of the game makes us more enthusiastic about the next part as new things about the apple is revealed.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Revelations</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">The game begins with our protagonist Ezio Auditore journeying to find the library of Altaïr. 
					Ezio has grown and weary of the assassins life.
					He is ambushed by the templars at Masyaf the assassin homeplace of Altaïr.
					Ezio escapes and travel to Constantinople to find the hidden keys of Altaïr's library before the templars. 
					Ezio works with the local assassin's who look up to Ezio as a mentor. 
					Ezio seeks the help of royal heir Prince Suleman but he also finds out that Suleman's uncle is a member of templar and now Ezio must race against time to find the keys and protect his loved ones. 
					The gameplay has become quite remarkable with the introduction of the hook blade allowing Ezio to use zip line, grenades and much more. 
					At the end Ezio finally gives up his assassin life. 
					The graphics have been upgraded a lot and the modern time period Desmond must find his way so that he can escape the Animus before his mind is wiped. 
					This game brings an end to the Ezio Trilogy. 
					The Ezio trilogy is the most loved all over the world as we see a young man from his birth as an assassin to his end.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed 3</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Assassin's Creed 3 begins with Desmond finding a precursor ISU warehouse. 
					The animus has an upgrade and new user interface. 
					The game begins with Haytham Kenway a member of templars traveling to New York to find the ISU warehouse. 
					He sets up templar order in New York. 
					Then we play as Conner Kenway his real name Kanien'kehá:ka who travels to Achilles a retired assassin to train and find the killer of her mother and destroy the templar order. 
					Many new things are revealed in the game bringing from to George Washington to Connor meeting Haytham. 
					This game has brought new features and weapons. We can now hunt animals and sell their skin for money and food.
					We can set traps for the same. 
					The new weapons have brought a new thrill but to be honest it does not match the feel as that of the Ezio trilogy but has a great impact to the storyline.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed 3:Liberation</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">The game starts with a new protagonist Aveline, a young woman living in New Orleans before and during the American Revolution.
					When her mother a freed slave, disappears, Aveline falls into the Assassins’ Brotherhood and starts stabbing Templars. 
					If you are looking for a more detailed account of her journey from child to killer, you will not get it in Assassin's Creed III: Liberation, you can only find in the characters bio.
					The gameplay is like that of Assassin's Creed 3. 
					The story is great and fun but overall, the game is good but not great and it does not have an impact to the main story line. 
					If you are playing the series in order you may want to skip it if want but I recommend you play just for fun.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed 4:Black Flag</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Assassin's Creed 4 is a smart, sprawling sequel that wisely places an emphasis on freedom and fun while trimming most of the fat that bogged down Assassin’s Creed III’s ambitious but uneven adventure. 
					The Golden Age of Piracy begins in 1715 and is presented with a much-appreciated lighter tone that isn’t afraid to make fun of itself in the name of an entertaining journey. 
					Abstergo has built a VR game based on memories of Edward Kenway and the whole game is a player working for Abstergo playing it. 
					Sailing across the massive expanse of The Caribbean, exploring gorgeous and unique islands, and getting yourself into all sorts of swashbuckling trouble provide some of the most rewarding and memorable stretches of gameplay I’ve experienced.
					Black flag side quest are much fun for even to sometime forget the main quests. 
					The main protagonist is Edward Kenway the father of Haytham and grandfather of Connor.
					He enjoys his life as a pirate but soon his quartermaster leaves him as he feels Edward does everything for his gain. 
					This saddens Edward and he decides to join the Assassin’s Creed for a worthy cause. 
					The gameplay is awesome from hiding in shadows to fun on land. 
					But the fun in the seas and ship battles make this game the best. 
					This game is so far the best game in the series.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Rogue</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">The game introduces us to an assassin Shay Patrick Cormac who has betrayed the assassins and joined the templar order. 
					Shay a member of the assassins is conflicted by the actions of the assassins and what the stand for. 
					This results him joining the templars and killing and hunting all hi ex-friends in the assassins. 
					In both good ways and bad, Rogue plays like a direct sequel to Black Flag, and carries on its strong emphasis on seafaring. 
					The map sends us around Albany, New York, the frozen waters of the North Atlantic, as well as plenty of small towns and quaint settlements, like the pumpkin-strewn Sleepy Hollow, dotted around. 
					Even though it can be on occasion a bit fuzzy around the edges with some dodgy shading, Rogue is a frequently pretty experience. 
					Sailing through blizzards while your ship cuts through the ice looks great and is thrilling. 
					Rogue have portrayed Shay as a cold-blooded killer, but that is in no way accurate; his story is nuanced, and the narrative is patiently unfolded. 
					The game is quite enjoyable and has improved a lot since the first game of the series . 
					The gameplay has become more and more fun and exciting.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Unity</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Assassin's Creed Unity is amazing, it was way ahead of its time, the parkour is stunning, and the story is fantastic based in Paris. 
					It tells us about the assassin Arno during the French revolution and his goal to reveal its truth The only flaws are that once you complete it there isn't really much to do besides fight people, parkour around, replay missions and solve the occasional crime. 
					The Co-op is not the best, but it is still awesome and gives you a great feeling when you and your teammates synchronize to do something together. 
					The combat is challenging until you fully upgrade yourself, you have full customization of weapons and outfits, the animations are beautiful, there is a ton of content to play. 
					It is also considered as the last true Assassin's Creed game, as most of the games that came after it did not have to do with assassins or templars than the other Assassin's Creeds.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Syndicate</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Syndicate smartly negotiates this internal conflict by dramatizing it in the form of its twin playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye. 
					The former is a devout Assassin, intent on stopping the Templars by tracking down the remaining pieces of Eden. 
					Her brother Jacob, however, is a pragmatist – a social reformer who rails against the Assassin’s burdensome legacy and wishes to help his city in more immediate ways, seemingly embodying my desire to move on from the tangled mysticism. 
					They are both extremely likeable, well-drawn protagonists, and the interaction between the two is laced with a lively sibling rivalry that brings levity to otherwise earnest cutscenes. 
					But their contrasting worldviews have the greatest positive impact on Syndicate’s structure, which is both engaging and meaningful. 
					Campaign missions, however, are different, with Jacob taking the lead in most of the core assassinations. 
					This is frustrating, especially since Evie is pitched as the stealthier of the pair. 
					Overall, the game is good and very much enjoyable with the anytime switch between the characters.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Origins</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">With Assassin’s Creed origins the game timeline is sent back to the 500-400 B.C century. 
					Based in Egypt the gameplay has very big change in the user interface, the movements, the weapons basically it is a very big change a has made the games more thrilling. 
					The game is based after the fall of cleopatra, Bayek of Siwa a medjay seek revenge for the murder of his son because of greed of templars. 
					Bayek and his wife Aya are both playable characters. 
					Bayek on his path to kill all the masked man involved in his son’s death. 
					Aya is working with cleopatra and uncovers a plot of great depth in their son’s death. 
					She brings bayek on board and they hunt the men in the plot. 
					Julius Caesar has a great amount of role in it.
					The end of this game marks the establishment/beginning of the Assassin’s order. 
					We are introduced to a new modern protagonist Lyla who is set to safeguard pieces of Eden from the templars. 
					This game is must play for ease to play the rest games.

			<h3>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</h3>
			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">Assassin's Creed Odyssey is et way before origins about a mercenary Kassandra or Alexios the two playable characters set in ancient Greek. 
					We can choose the character we want to play be it Kassandra or Alexios. 
					If we choose any one the other becomes the role they are set, and it does not depend on any choice it was added for gender equality purpose. 
					I personally recommend Kassandra as it makes the game more different than Alexios(no effect on the story). 
					The young mercenary was wronged by the prophecy which later turns out as a plot of the Cult of Kosmos. 
					The mercenary must find his family and defeat the cult. 
					The game brings many changes from that of origins, the player now has special abilities and can now sail the sea anytime and wage sea battles unlike origins.
					We can now fight wars between Athens and Sparta siding with any one of them. 
					I was inclined towards Sparta because our character is from Sparta, though Sparta wronged the family i felt slightly inclined towards it. 
					The game does not have any feel of the Assassin’s and people do not like it because of the name and no Assassins feel but I liked the game and its gameplay is awesome. 
					The end of the game reveals many truths about the Isu.

			<div class=" col-md-6 agileits_welcome_grid_left">
				<br>
				<br>
				<p  style=" text-align: left;">This game brings us to the age of Vikings. 
					Eivor is the main character and we can choose its gender. 
					The story known so far is how the Vikings raid England and the English try to stop them. 
					You may think that the Vikings are the bad ones but no, As clear from the trailer the English are the templars and Vikings are the Assassin. 
					The game has just released and has blown off many minds.
					Assassin’s Creed Black Flag is considred the best game in the series but valhalla gives it a tough competition.
					The game is thrilling and worth it.
					The gameplay form Odyssey has improved and ubisoft has removed all the mistakes they did with Odyssey.
					The environmnet texture has improved a lot.
					I suggest everyone to play as soon as possible.
