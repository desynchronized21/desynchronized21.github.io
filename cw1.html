					<br>
					<br>
                    <p style="text-align: left;">Master Yoda is sent to the coral moon of Rugosa to convince King Katuunko to permit the Republic to build a base in Toydarian territory. 
                        As the Toydarian King Katuunko and his retinue await the arrival of their Jedi, 
                        Asajj Ventress arrives and with a hologram of Count Dokku try to sway the Toydarian king to join the Seperatist cause. 
                        In orbit of the moon, Master Yoda's ship is attacked by the seperatist frigates forcing him to take an escape pod to the moon while his ship escaped the system.
                        Three clones:Lieutenant Thire, Jek, and Rys,accompany him to the surface.

                        The Republic ship leaves the system, that Ventress uses as point to prove herp point of the Republic's weekness.
                         She tries to convince Katuunko to join the seperatist but is interepted by a holo message from Yoda.
                         Ventress suggests a deal that if Yoda can escape her best troops, then Toydaria will be free to join the Republic. 
                         But if he should fail and the droids prevail, Toydaria will join the Separatists.
                        ,br>
                        Yoda agrees to her proposal and he and his troops march through the coral forest as a Separatist landing ship carrying a full battalion of droids arrives. 
                        Yoda and his men then face off against a large number of droids and several tanks. 
                        The tanks face difficulty in penetrating the dense coral forest, f
                        orcing the droid commander to send his troops out on foot, allowing the clones to ambush them in small groups. 
                        Unfortunately, Thire is injured and they are forced to retreat
                        
                        Yoda and the clones make their way to a cave, to rest and recover. 
                        Inside the cave, the clones are uneasy about their situation as they are outnumbered and out-gunned.
                         To raise spirits, Yoda gives his troopers a small lesson about them being individuals despite their origin as clones, 
                         and that it is their mind which makes them strong, not their numbers or weapons.
                         <br>

                        Yoda faces approaching droidekas.
                        
                        As the droid column approaches, Master Yoda decides to face them alone, ordering his clone troopers to stay out of sight until their help is truly needed. 
                        The droids report the current situation to Ventress, who in turn orders them to open fire. Yoda ends up cutting the whole battalion to pieces, 
                        and angered, Ventress sends out ten droidekas to deal with the Jedi Master. Just before the droidekas can finish the Jedi Master, 
                        Thire launches their last rocket at an overhanging bluff, sending an avalanche of rock crashing down on the droideka reinforcements.
                        <br>
                        Katuunko is impressed by the display, and opts to have Toydaria join the Republic. 
                        Furious about the outcome, Dooku orders Ventress to kill the king. 
                        Ventress knocks the king's Toydarian Guards unconscious and prepares to deal the killing blow,when Master Yoda arrives , 
                        stopping Ventress mid-swing. Rather than surrender, Ventress quickly triggers an avalanche with pre-planted explosive charges, 
                        using it as a distraction to escape. King Katuunko gladly accepts Yoda's offer to join the Republic,
                         and Republic gunships come to retrieve the group.

				<h3 style="text-align: center;">Episode 2: Rising Malevolence</h3>
				<div class=" agileits_welcome_grid_left">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="text-align: left;">Jedi Master Plo Koon and Clone Commander Wolffe locate the Malevolence in the Abregado system and 
						are perpared to engage it in the Triumphant. 
						Before engaging clone commander Wolffe contacts Coruscant on the order of Master Plo Koon and tell the Jedi Council their position.
						Then they contact Anakin Skywalker and his apprentice Ashoka Tano who are in the nearby Bith System asking for reinforcements.
						Anakin is unable to help them as he has been ordered by the Jedi Council to protect the Bith system.

						The Triumphant's communications are then jammed by General Grievous.
						The Malevolence's massive ion cannon fires, knocking out power on all three Republic attack cruisers,
						 and leaving them defenseless against Grievous' turbolasers. Plo Koon, along with clone troopers Sinker, Boost and Commander Wolffe, 
						 manage to board an escape pod, just before their cruiser is destroyed. Aboard the Malevolence, Dooku orders Grievous to deploy the pod hunters, 
						 in order to find and kill any survivors and keep their secret weapon's position a secret.
						
						The Malevolence fires its ion cannon, destroying Plo Koon's fleet.
						
						Meanwhile, Anakin and Ahsoka inform Masters Obi-Wan Kenobi, Mace Windu and Yoda and Chancellor Palpatine, 
						about the loss of communication with Plo Koon. 
						All four tell Anakin and Ahsoka not to go out to the Abregado system to look for survivors, despite Ahsoka's objections. 
						Mace tells Anakin that all their task forces have been assigned to defend their supply lines. After the meeting, 
						Anakin scolds Ahsoka for her outburst of insubordination. Nevertheless, a short time later, they take off for the Abregado System in the Twilight.
						Ashoka asks why she was scolded when Anakin himself is doing the same. To this Anakin explains that he is obeying the coucil by leaving the fleet 
						in the Bith System and going there himself to check for survivors.
						
						Back on Coruscant, Obi-Wan, who knows Anakin all too well, guesses that Anakin has gone off alone, 
						and both he and Palpatine issue repeated demands for Anakin to resume command of his fleet.
						<br>
						<br>
						<img src="images/Star Wars/cws1e2.jpg" height="450" width="900" class="centerss">
						<br>
						<br>
						Back in the debris field, while attempting to fix their escape pod, Plo and the clones spot another pod. 
						However, upon closer inspection, they realize it has been broken open and the clones inside have been killed by a pod hunter. 
						The group then witnesses one of the pod hunters attack another nearby escape pod, breaking it open and killing all inside. 
						Then the pod hunter crew notices their escape pod and latches onto it. Plo and his men fight and destroy the pod hunter, 
						but this alerts Grievous that Republic survivors are still in the debris field.
						
						Soon after Plo's victory, Anakin and Ahsoka arrive and rescue him and his men. 
						As they are preparing to depart, the Malevolence arrives near their location. Anakin and Ahsoka shut down the Twilight's systems, 
						hoping to blend in with the debris and avoid detection.
						
						The Twilight tries to escape the Malevolence's ion cannon.
						
						Unfortunately, they forget to shut down the on-board medical droid, whose faint signal alerts Grievous to their location. 
						Forced to flee the blast from the ion cannon, the Twilight narrowly escapes with a desperate hyperspace jump. Grievous reluctantly 
						informs Count Dooku that the survivors have escaped, meaning the Republic will learn of the Separatists' secret weapon. Dooku, 
						vexed, says he will have to contact his master.
						
						Once the Twilight reaches Anakin's fleet, Commander Wolffe thanks Anakin for assisting them. 
						Anakin and Plo then contact the Jedi Council, informing them of the secret weapon and its capabilities. 
						Anakin asks Ahsoka to come with him, claiming that they should both share the responsibility for their actions.

				<div class=" agileits_welcome_grid_left">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="text-align: left;">After several attack by the Malevolence on Jedi cruisers, Anakin decides to strike back. 
						His plans to use the new Y-Wing bombers to destroy the Separatist flagship's bridge, 
						killing General Grievous and destroying the ship. 
						However, both Plo Koon and Ahsoka think that his plan is too aggressive. 
						Meanwhile, the Malevolence destroys another supply convoy, somewhere in the Outer Rim. After finishing off the final ships, 
						Dooku contacts General Grievous and gives him a new target: the Kaliida Shoals Medical Center.

						Admiral Yularen contacts the Kaminoan physician Nala Se on the Medical Center, 
						warning her of a possible attack. However, she does not believe that they will have enough time to evacuate all of her 60,000 wounded patients.
						
						Anakin and Ahsoka leave their Star Destroyer with their squadron of Y-wing bombers, 
						along with the Kel Dor Jedi Master Plo Koon serving as a fighter escort in his modified Delta-7B Aethersprite-class light interceptor. 
						After a hyperspace jump, Anakin's Shadow Squadron of Clone trooper pilots reach the Kaliida Nebula. 
						While traveling through it, Master Plo is horrified to learn that they are taking the Balmorra Run. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<img src="images/Star Wars/cws1e3.png" height="450" width="900" class="centerss">
						<br>
						<br>
						Before they can turn around, though, they fly into a nest of Neebrays. 
						Shadow Squadron is able to navigate through it, although Matchstick's ship sustains damage to its port engine. 
						Just as they reach the Kaliida Medical Center, the Malevolence comes out of hyperspace. After it fires its ion cannon at Shadow Squadron, 
						Anakin loses almost half of his Y-Wings to its disabling blast and is forced to make a new plan of attack. 
						The Malevolence then prepares to target the medical center.

						As its mega-ion cannon charges, Shadow Squadron opens fire on it, causing the ion cannon to backfire when General Grievous tries 
						to unleash it once more on the medical station. The blast also damages the ship's hyperdrive, preventing it from escaping into hyperspace. 
						With newly arrived Republic capital ships led by Obi-Wan Kenobi and Admiral Yularen firing on him, Grievous orders the wounded flagship back 
						to Separatist-held space. Anakin and the rest of Shadow Squadron then board the medical station, where they are congratulated by Nala Se. 
						Anakin, however, mourns the losses of his men among Shadow Squadron, despite the great victory their lives had earned.

				<h3 style="text-align: center;">Episode 4: Destroy Malevolence</h3>
				<div class=" agileits_welcome_grid_left">
					<br>
					<br>
					<p style="text-align: left;">The Malevolence is heavily damaged and trailed by three Star Destroyers.
						 Unable to jump to hyperspace, Grievous is forced to buy time. Luckily for him, Darth Sidious and Count Dooku had arranged for Senator Amidala 
						 (with C-3PO in her company) to fly directly onto his ship, herself believing that she was heading for negotiations with the Inter Galactic Banking Clan 
						 Supreme Executive. Once Padmé comes out of hyperspace, she is pulled into the warship via a tractor beam. 
						 She manages to contact the Republic forces, asking them to continue their attacks, regardless of her own safety. 
						 However, Anakin orders their ships to cease their attack.

						Padmé rigs her ship's engines to explode so that when Grievous comes on board to capture her, the galaxy would be rid of him. 
						Unfortunately, he survives the blast and has his droids search for her and 3PO. 
						Anakin heads a rescue mission composed of him, Obi-Wan and R2 to save her. 
						The Twilight latches onto the Malevolence by an emergency air lock and they board the ship and manage to contact the senator, 
						who gives them her location. They set a rendezvous point at the warship's transportation system. They each get on separate trains. 
						Anakin uses the Force to bring Padmé over to him because a super battle droid destroyed the rest of Padmé's track. 
						Obi-Wan tries to get Threepio, but he gets hit by another train in transit.

						<br>
						Obi-Wan duels with Grievous after dispatching his droids and manages to avoid the cyborg's clutches. 
						He reaches the Twilight along with the rest of the group and as they leave the ship, 
						Grievous pursues in his starfighter. The droids on the warship then try to jump to hyperspace, 
						Anakin directs the ship's navi to crash into the moon and General Grievous watch in shock and horror as the ship crashes into the moon.

						While Grievous was not killed on the Malevolence, his warship is finally destroyed and Senator Amidala is rescued from the ship. 
						Grievous ends the communications with the Count due to the shame of the ship being destroyed.
